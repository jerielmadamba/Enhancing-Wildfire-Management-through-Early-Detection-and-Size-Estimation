# Centennial-College-Capstone-Project

This project which I completed for my capstone in Business Analytics and Insights program at Centennial College, Toronto, ON. This study's main focus is on predicting the potential size of wildfires in the Alberta province. This comprehensive study explores different aspects of wildfire behaviour with the goal of creating prediction models that can precisely anticipate the size of fires, providing crucial information for the management and prevention of wildfires in the Alberta area.
